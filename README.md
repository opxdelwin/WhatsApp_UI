# whatsapp_ui

**Hi, welcome here!**

Myself ***Delwin***, a passionate `FlutterFire` Developer.

## Introduction

This is a UI clone of WhatsApp that I worked on to learn the framework during my initial years, and to produce content (check out on Instagram).

Below attached are some screenshots and feel free to find the source code. This project was done quite a while ago, hence there mayn't be much `Best Practices`.

Thank you & Happy Coding :)
